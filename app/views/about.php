                    This website is a passion project dedicated to showcasing <i>the vibrant cafe</i> culture of Ho Chi Minh City. Our goal is to create a comprehensive hub where coffee lovers can explore and discover cafes that suit their tastes and needs. Whether you're searching by name, district, or specific preferences, our platform makes it easy to find the perfect spot.

                    Each cafe is detailed with its unique features, from address and price range to a set of descriptive tags—think 'cozy', 'pet-friendly', or 'great for working' — ensuring you can pick a place that matches your mood or purpose. Beyond just a directory, we aim to connect people with the diverse coffee experiences that make this city special, one cup at a time.
